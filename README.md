# Project Work autumn 2024
**TBM4500**

This github repository is created as a supplementary resource to my specialization project conducted during the fall of 2024. In this project I have solved Laplace' equation using 12 dfifferent Physics Informed Neural Networks, and comparing them to PLAXIS analysis. Nr 5 & 10 did not converge. The trained models are saved to files named i.pth, with i going from 1 to 12. These models are imported to the notbook "PLAXIS_results.ipynb" in the folder PLAXIS. This is where the comparison is done. The models are made with the code in the folder "Final_calculation". As the name suggest, a lot of trial and error was done before arriving at these models.

The code uses machine learning library PyTorch 2.4.0+cpu.
