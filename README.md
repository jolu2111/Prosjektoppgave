**TBM4500**
This github repository is created as a supplementary resource to my specialization project conducted during the fall of 2024. In this project I have solved Laplace' equation using 12 dfifferent Physics Informed Neural Networks. Nr 5 & 10 did not converge. The trained models are saved to files named i.pth, with i going from 1 to 12. The code uses machine learning loibrary PyTorch 2.4.0+cpu.
